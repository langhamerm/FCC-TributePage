                        <p>New genres appear on an almost daily basis in electronic music, but few have had the impact
                            of dubstep. From the grimy nightclubs of Croydon to mainstream radio airplay, via
                            high‑profile endorsement from acts as disparate as Snoop Dogg and Radiohead, its meteoric
                            rise is unrivalled. With roots in the predominantly London‑flavoured two‑step and grime
                            scenes, where experimental garage remixes were often made with FL Studio, dubstep has
                            evolved its own production values that have set new precedents for the treatment of low‑end
                            frequencies.</p>
                        <p>Labels like <code>Tempa</code> and <code>Hyperdub</code> laid the foundations with artists
                            such as Horsepower
                            Productions, Kode9, Skream, Benga and Burial. Not to be outdone, Dub Police and Sub Soldiers
                            exposed us to Caspa and Rusko, two of the scene's most popular international ambassadors;
                            they play to a weekly global audience of thousands. Throw in Skream's platinum‑selling remix
                            of La Roux's 'In For The Kill' and you've got yourself a new sonic phenomenon.</p>

                        <br>
                        <p>Dubstep's main characteristics lie in its rhythms, bass and dark sound, with heavy use of
                            spatial atmospherics, low‑end frequencies and swing. Initially based around a
                            garage‑influenced, two‑step kick and snare beat, the genre has evolved over the last few
                            years, with an increasing number of tracks containing a half‑step rhythm. This has become
                            the form of dubstep that most people will be familiar with, and it's a characteristic that
                            distinguishes it from most other dance music.</p>
                        <p>Dubstep also has many similarities to <code>drum & bass:</code> both rely on the use of
                            shuffled and
                            syncopated hi‑hat patterns to give the beats movement, and heavy sub‑bass for warmth and
                            depth. The tempo of dubstep is generally around the 140bpm mark, which provides potential
                            for DJs to mix it with breakbeat, whilst an increasing number of drum & bass DJs are using
                            dubstep in their sets too.</p>
                        <p>Although there are stylistic similarities between dubstep and drum & bass, the latter has
                            suffered from stagnation in the past through the over-use of various techniques, samples and
                            sounds. One of the most exciting elements of dubstep is the freedom to move away from a set
                            song structure and the reliance on breaks and bass drops. Like most forms of electronic
                            dance music, a lot of dubstep is created for the dancefloor and produced to be heard on a
                            loud sound system. Because the music is typically driven by its sub‑bass, it can be hard to
                            feel the full effect of dubstep on an inferior system such as computer speakers or
                            earphones.</p>

                        <br>
                        <p>A key feature of dubstep production is the use of atmospherics and textures to create a full
                            and spacious mix. The use of silence, pads and minor keys builds tension and expresses
                            emotion. Even though dubstep is dominated by bass and beats, they are softened by a dub
                            reggae‑influenced use of echo, reverb and panoramic stereo to add depth and space.</p>
                        <p>Good examples of these techniques come from drum & bass‑turned‑dubstep duo Kryptic Minds and
                            Mercury Prize nominee Burial, in particular the latter's use of obscure samples,
                            pitch‑shifting and overlaying effects. Burial's work is very different to the majority of
                            commercially successful and dancefloor‑friendly dubstep tracks, and bears a lot of
                            similarities to works by Brian Eno or Philip Glass.</p>
                        <p>In my quest to decide what would fit best in an informative dubstep tutorial, I asked
                            numerous producers, and there was a unanimous verdict: inform people that making dubstep is
                            more than just automating a filter cutoff to make a 'wobbly' bass line. Although I will look
                            at how to make the type of wobbly bass line that has become synonymous with the genre, you
                            only have to investigate my recommended listening (see box) to hear the variety and contrast
                            dubstep has to offer.</p>

                        <header>Kick & Sub</header>
                        <br>
                        <p>There is no set method to making dubstep. A lot of tracks are built around their dominant
                            low‑frequency elements, namely the sub‑bass and kick drum. If you have chosen a sample or
                            programmed a hook that you think you can be the basis of a dubstep track, by all means work
                            from that first, but as there is an emphasis on the lower end of the sonic spectrum, it is
                            essential that you select a kick and sub‑bass that gel together.</p>
                        <p>As in many electronic styles, drums are commonly created through overlaid samples. Try to
                            merge contrasting sounds together when making your drum tracks, as the tendency to overlay
                            similar‑sounding samples will have a negative effect on the sound. And don't be afraid of
                            variety: try using hip‑hop or house kicks alongside more obviously dubstep‑friendly sounds.
                            You could even use a pitched‑down basketball bouncing. If a more organic sound is what
                            you're after, use live or ethnic drum samples. It's always best to have an abundance of
                            decent drum samples available, as each individual kick, snare or hat sample can completely
                            change the dynamic of your track, particularly the shuffle and swing aspect.</p>
                        <p>The use of single or multiple sine waves is a good starting point for making dubstep
                            sub‑bass. There is no harmonic content in a straight sine wave, and the C0‑C1 octave range
                            will produce a fundamental frequency sitting at approximately 30‑60Hz. When picking a kick
                            drum sound, therefore, there is no point in choosing a really bassy 808 kick-drum sample, as
                            it will not work well with such a sub‑bass. Instead, start with a kick drum that hits higher
                            up the frequency spectrum than the sub-bass: that way, the two will not sound muddy in the
                            mix. (You could, of course, use an 808 sample for your sub‑bass itself...)</p>
                        <p>Aside from selecting elements that match each other, there are several ways of making parts
                            sit well together in the mix. One of the easiest methods is to use EQ to cut away unwanted
                            frequency ranges. It's always better to take away frequencies than to boost them; if your
                            drum sample is lacking low‑end presence, <code>EQ</code> can add it, but it will sound
                            better if you use
                            one that has that presence in the first place.</p>
                        <p>Something that has become quite popular in electronic dance music is the use of a
                            <code>side‑chained compressor</code> to 'duck' the volume of the sub‑bass when the kick drum
                            hits. This
                            is a great way of making sure the kick cuts through in the mix, but it shouldn't be seen as
                            the be‑all and end‑all, and there are certain techniques that can help it work better. One
                            such is to duplicate the kick-drum track and use a closed hi‑hat sound instead of a
                            kick-drum sample to trigger the compressor. A hi‑hat hit has a shorter tail than a kick
                            drum, meaning that the resulting ducking will be shorter and not sound laboured. To make
                            sure the hat isn't part of the mix, give it a dedicated channel and mute it from the master
                            out.</p>

                        <br>
                        <p>Reverberated snare drums play heavily in dubstep's make‑up — take Skream's remix of 'In For
                            The Kill' as an example. To obtain a typical dubstep snare drum, you need to layer a snare
                            sample, or multiple snare drums, with a clap. A snare drum that punches in at around 200Hz
                            is a good place to start; the clap will take care of the high end. Then, by using a reverb
                            effect on the layered samples, you can add the space and width you need. There are no set
                            parameters for layering snare drums or adding reverb: it's all about defining the sound you
                            want to create. If you're interested in making club‑friendly dubstep, each aspect will need
                            to be fine‑tuned and balanced so the mix will sound good on a loud sound system. If you're
                            hoping to make more expressive or abstract dubstep, the freedom is all yours. You can choose
                            to use anything you want as a drum sample, and innovation is good.</p>
                        <p>To illustrate dubstep programming, I've created some example patterns using a basic drum rack
                            in Ableton Live. As you'll see, I'm using two kick drums — one low and one high — a snare, a
                            clap, a rimshot, three closed hi‑hats, an open hi‑hat and a ride. These are labelled in the
                            screenshots.</p>

                    <section id="Swing_Time" class="main-section">
                        <header>Swing Time</header>
                        <br>
                        <p>In general, placement of hi‑hats is incredibly important to making your beats shuffle and
                            swing. Unlike house or techno, dubstep uses a lot of placements on the off‑beat. Although
                            this can feel unnatural to the ears, the combinations of hats and other percussion samples
                            can be built up to create excellent beats. Slowly layering elements and making sure they
                            work well with others can involve a lot of listening and time, particularly if you're using
                            triplets.</p>
                        <p>Velocity is also incredibly important in making your beats sound more natural. Even though
                            your beats might be heavily quantised, not only will changing the velocity help swing, it
                            can take the edge off highly processed beats. You can also use classic drum breaks chopped
                            up and layered in with your programmed beats. This technique is standard practice when
                            making drum & bass, and it can help soften the sound and add movement.</p>

                        <br>
                        <p>I mentioned that sine waves are a good starting point for creating a subby dubstep bass.
                            Let's look at bass sounds and bass lines in a bit more detail. As a starting point, use a
                            two‑oscillator synth to generate two sine waves an octave apart, and route both through a
                            low‑pass filter. Turn the filter resonance up full and slowly move the cutoff anti-clockwise
                            until you can detect a change in the feel of the bass coming from your speakers. Finding the
                            right settings for the filter cutoff and resonance will trigger self‑oscillation, making the
                            bass thicker.</p>
                        <p>If you want to add brightness to this bass, you can then distort it or add other effects.
                            Guitar processing and effects plug‑ins are a great method of changing the sound of your bass
                            and adding distortion, warmth and harmonic content. You can also add movement with an LFO.
                            Applying a high‑pass filter to most other mix elements, such as leads and pads, will ensure
                            plenty of space for your sub‑bass.</p>

                        <header>Low‑end Techniques</header>
                        <br>
                        <p>Many soft synths will let you use multiple voices for a unison‑style effect, which can
                            radically change your bass line. Adding multiple voices and detuning them creates rawness,
                            and is a technique that is used a lot in making the 'reese bass' commonly found in drum &
                            bass. Another trick is to set the synth that's playing your bass line to monophonic mode,
                            overlapping the notes in your MIDI sequence, and adding legato and portamento/glide. This
                            can blend the sound together and give smoother‑sounding note transitions.</p>
                        <p>Instead of having one single bass line that sounds repetitive, it's also worth experimenting
                            with creating more than one bass sound. Once you are happy with your bass hook, you can
                            either chop up the MIDI sequence so that it plays alternating sounds, or bounce each bass
                            line down to audio and slice them up that way. The variation this provides will help develop
                            an almost story‑like quality, where one sound will ask a question and the other will answer.

                        <p>Your choice of lead sound can play a vital role in your music. Filling the frequency ranges
                            throughout your mix is important, so with the sub, kick and snare taking up the low end, the
                            200‑800Hz mid‑range is a good area for your leads to sit. An extremely wide,
                            stereo‑intensive sound won't be direct enough — leave the width for your pads and effects.
                        </p>
                        <p>Creating a riff or rhythm with your hi‑hats allows you to work well with your leads and
                            mid‑range bass lines later in the track. If you apply a similar rhythm to the MIDI sequence
                            of your lead, it will work well with the overall swing of the track. Alternatively, adding a
                            contrasting rhythm to your lead will help provide the feeling of a shuffle. Playing one
                            sound off another will also help the narrative element of your track. As with Massive, most
                            synths will have a wealth of presets to gain ideas from. Choosing complementary sounds when
                            balancing your leads and bass lines is important. You can apply the same techniques for
                            leads as for bass lines, such as detuning, glides and automating filter cutoffs.</p>
